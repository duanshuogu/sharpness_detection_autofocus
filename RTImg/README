This folder is for all imagesets. 

Imagesets are listed by Subject. The filenames will indicate focus distance and subject distance. 

For Example: 
001-550-340.jpeg indicates Subject 001, 550mm away, focused at 340mm. 

The autofocused image will always be designated as NNN-DDDD-0000, and will be placed at the beginning of every set. 

All sets are organized in ascending order by focus distance, not chronologically. All focus distance information was 
taken from File Metadata and Camera EXIF and is only accurate to whatever degree the lens permits.
